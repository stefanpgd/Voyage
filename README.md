# 🏝 Voyage
The goal of this project is working towards a small demo where I can draw in tiny island surrounded by sea & clouds.
This project us to see if I can tackle some interesting techniques will using them together in a single app, those techniques being:
- 🌄 Terrain generation for landscape/mountains 
- 🌊 Water
- ⛅ Volumetric Clouds 

Aim is to learn a set of different things, in no particular order:
Tesselation pipeline of DX12, How to readback data, deferred rendering, different methods of uploading/updating buffers,
volumetric rendering, terrain generation, implementing editor tools, water shaders (and how to make them look good),
and much more.

Project has some extensibility with the techniques and idea, but let's not be too ambitious yet. 
Since we all like to start new projects anyway.

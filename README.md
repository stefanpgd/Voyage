# ‚õèÔ∏è Steel - A DirectX 12 Framework
This is my personal framework build with DirectX 12 which is used for my personal projects.
Steel gets continously iterated with each project, since I usually find the need for new systems with different projects.

### Contents:
- A rendering framework that supports: _Rasterization, Compute pipeline and DirectX Ray Tracing_
- A simple engine loop to work with (Start, Update, Render)
- Framework classes like `Input` or `Mathematics`
- Model loading support for glTF files

### üìö Example/Reference Project(s)
These are example projects to use as reference, or to quickly build off from for the next project:
- TinyHybrid, a small setup of rasterized models with ray traced shadows (DXR)
- HelloCompute, a setup of a compute pipeline outputting UV coordinates to the screen

### ‚úçÔ∏è Work
These are different project(s) that I've made using Steel.

- [Flux - Particle Simulations](https://github.com/stefanpgd/Flux)
- [Nova - PBR Renderer](https://github.com/stefanpgd/Nova)
